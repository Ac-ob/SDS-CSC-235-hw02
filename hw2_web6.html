				<div class="hide"> <img src="duration_num.png" width="400" height="100"></div>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>independence: The duration of a call is independent from the number of animals involved in the call.</li>
					<li>non-independence: The duration of a call is not independent from the number of animals involved in the call.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> This hypothesis of independence was made because there doesnt seem to be a correlation in the graph. </p>

			<h2> Hypothesis2:</h2> </div>
				<div class="hide"><img src="year_range.png" width="400" height="100"></div>
			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>Hnull: Number of rehabilitation has not changed across years.</li>
					<li>Ha: Number of rehabilitations have significantly increased since 2018.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> This hypothesis was made because there seems to be an increase of rehabilitations after 2018</p>

			<h2> Hypothesis3:</h2></div>
				<div class="hide"><img src="condition_age.png" width="400" height="100"></div>

			<div>
				<ul>
					<li>Hnull: There is no significant difference between the number of injuries between Adult and infant animals.</li>
					<li>Ha: Adult animals get injured more often than infant animals.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> This hypothesis was made because there seems to be a larger number of injuries among adult animals. </p>
